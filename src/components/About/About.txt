I am a final year Mathematics student in St Stephenâ€™s College, currently awaiting my results. I have always been keen and curious about new and existing technologies, and love to learn about them. 
For the past year I have devoted myself to learning new programming languages and software administration skills (namely, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Git / Github, Linux CLI). I am still a beginner and am actively working towards honing my skills.
Having taught myself all the aforementioned languages and skills, I love challenges and solving problems.
